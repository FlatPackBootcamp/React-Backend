# The Pizzaria API

## Intro

This is the pizzaria API to be used during unit 2.

This api allows you to use all CRUD functions and has the theme of Pizzas.

Feel free to edit and deploy as you see fit.

Basically the students can either use the API key to make unauthenticated requests to the app, or can signup and sign in and use the JWT to authenticate.

API Documentation is [here](./Pizzaria_API_Documentation.md) and should be distributed to the students.
