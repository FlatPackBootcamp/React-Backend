# Pizaria API Documentation

Welcome to the Pizzaria API, the perfect backend to learn React.

This api allows you to keep a personal databse of all the pizzas that you love. You'll be able to create, read, update, and delete pizzas.

Be aware, that whilst the API is set up to be personal to you, your instructors will be able to see what you create on the backend, and it is linked to you. So please have fun and make funny names, but let's steer clear of offensive.
